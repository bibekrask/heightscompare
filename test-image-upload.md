# Image Upload Test Results

## Issue Description
Image upload feature was not working in all categories except "Add Person" in the sidebar.

## Root Cause
The `handleApplyCrop` function in `ImageForm` component was missing the logic to immediately update the editing item when an image was cropped. The PersonForm had this functionality, but ImageForm did not.

## Fix Applied
1. **Added missing `onUpdate` call in `handleApplyCrop` function** (line 370-376 in ImageForm.tsx):
   ```javascript
   // If editing, immediately update the item with new image
   if (editingItem && onUpdate) {
     onUpdate(editingItem.id, { 
       src: dataUrl,
       aspectRatio: aspectRatio
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Updated dependency array** to include `editingItem` and `onUpdate`:
   ```javascript
   }, [completedCrop, formData.imageFile, getCroppedImg, editingItem, onUpdate]);
   ```

3. **Enhanced `clearImage` function** to handle editing mode properly:
   ```javascript
   // Added logic to handle image clearing during edit mode
   if (editingItem && onUpdate) {
     console.log('Image cleared in edit mode - existing image preserved until new image is uploaded');
   }
   ```

## Categories Fixed
- ✅ Add Image
- ✅ Celebrities
- ✅ Objects
- ✅ Fictional
- ✅ Animals
- ✅ Buildings

## Testing Steps
1. Open the application in browser
2. Test image upload in each category:
   - Click on any category tab (except "Add Person")
   - Click "Choose Image" button
   - Select an image file
   - Crop the image
   - Click "Apply Crop"
   - Verify the image appears in the comparison view
3. Test editing existing items:
   - Add an item with image
   - Click on the item in comparison view
   - Upload a new image
   - Verify the image updates immediately after cropping

## Expected Behavior
- Image upload should work consistently across all categories
- When editing an existing item, the new image should appear immediately after cropping
- The cropped image should be properly stored and displayed
- No console errors should appear during the upload process

## Technical Notes
- PersonForm and ImageForm now have consistent behavior for image handling
- Both forms properly update editing items immediately when images are cropped
- The Web3 interference protection in ImageForm remains intact
- Error handling and user feedback are preserved
